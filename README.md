# Sample Search Engine README

This repository contains files that serve as example search algorithms that can be used to solve simple games such as the eight puzzle and the Towers of Hanoi problem. The search algorithms are found in the files AStar.py, BreadthFS.py, IterativeDDFS.py, and ItrDFS.py. These files implement examples of the breadth first search, iterative depth first search, iterative-deepening depth first search, and Astar search algorithms. In each file there is a heading that explains how to run the file from the command line. Also it is important to note that the runtime of these files can vary by a great deal depending on the heuristic or the game that is selected by the user. For example, I would not recommend running the breadth first search file to solve the eight puzzle as the algorithm by nature can be very inefficient with this type of problem and will potentially run infinitely without being able to find a solution.
